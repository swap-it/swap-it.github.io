## Support and Issues

Different types of questions or discussions correspond to different avenues of communication; check the descriptions below to ensure you choose the right method.
Need help troubleshooting your system? First, search the issues if others have had similar issues, and if their solution works for you. 
If not, raise a new issue on 'Issues' page. 
If you identify bugs, have suggestions for improvements, or a question specific to one package, you can open an issue on GitHub.

## Pull Requests

When you feel comfortable enough to suggest a specific change directly to the code, you can submit a pull request.
Pull requests are welcome for any repositories that are used within this use-case. 
See the Contributing page for more details and etiquette on how to contribute.
